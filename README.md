## (In Progress) Python Weather App
This is a self-directed project. For this project, I wanted to try out some Python by using Flask and connecting it to React for the front end. 

## Goals

## Tech Stack


## Process
I first set up my Flask project following the documentation: 

`mkdir python-weather-app`\
`cd python-weather-app`\
`python3 -m venv .venv`\

Activate the virtual environment:
`. .venv/bin/activate`\

Install Flask
`pip install Flask`

Create a new file in the project
`touch app.py`\
